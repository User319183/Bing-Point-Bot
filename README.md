# Bing-Point-Bot
For https://rewards.bing.com/

# How it works:
1. We access `http://www.bing.com/search?q=` so we can begin making random search queries to boost our points for https://rewards.bing.com/
2. We create a list of random search terms
3. We get a random search term from the list
4. Every 3 seconds, we open a new tab with a random search term. After 2 seconds, close that tab. This process gets repeated 10 times  (you can change that). We make it so we don't get the same search result twice in a row

**Create an account at https://rewards.bing.com/ for this to work!!**

**This code will be getting updated**
